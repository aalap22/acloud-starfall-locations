 acloud-starfall-locations
ACLOUD GURU python project to find starfall locations near you

there are two programes. One from professionally created source and one that I created.
Naming convention will help you figure it out.

Instructions to run the code:
from terminal:
python3 starfall-professional.py
or
python3 ch-2-12-Snakes-Meteors.py

Note:
in both the codes, my location is set statically. You need to change the longitude and latitude under mylocation to be specific to where you are.
